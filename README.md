# bevy_pixel_camera

A simple pixel-perfect camera plugin for Bevy, suitable for pixel-art.

This crates makes it possible to correctly display low-resolution 2d
graphics with Bevy's default renderer and sprites.

While it is possible to achieve pixel-perfect rendering with Bevy's own
camera and `OrthographicProjection`, doing so correctly requires to
configure it in a specific way (you can't just use
`OrhtographicCameraBundle`).

This plugin provides a camera which can be easily configured by specifying
either the size of the virtual pixels, or the desired resolution.

Note that if either the width or the height of your sprite is not divisible
by 2, you need to change the anchor of the sprite (which is at the center by
default), or it will not be pixel aligned.

Also note that Bevy uses linear sampling by default for textures, which is
not what you want for pixel art. The easiest way to change this is to set
the default_sampler on the ImagePlugin:

```rust
    App::new()
        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins.set(ImagePlugin::default_nearest()))
        ...
```

The crate also includes a separate plugin to put an opaque border around the
desired resolution. This way, if the window size is not an exact multiple of
the virtual resolution, anything out of bounds will still be hidden.

A small example is included in the crate. Run it with:

```console
cargo run --example flappin
```

## Comparison with other methods

There is several possible methods to render pixel-art based games. This
crate simply upscale each sprite, and correctly align them on a virtual
pixel grid. Another option would be to render the sprites to an offscreen
texture, and then upscale only this texture. There is advantages and
drawbacks to both approaches:

- the offscreen texture method is probably more efficient in most cases;
- the method in this crate allows for smoother scrolling and movement of
  sprites, if you're willing to temporarily break the alignment on virtual
  pixels (this would be even more effective with a dedicated upscaling
  shader).

## Example code

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;
use bevy::sprite::Anchor;
use bevy_pixel_camera::{
    PixelCameraBundle, PixelCameraPlugin
};

fn main() {
    App::new()
        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins.set(ImagePlugin::default_nearest()))
        .add_plugin(PixelCameraPlugin)
        .add_startup_system(setup)
        .run();
}

fn setup(
    mut commands: Commands,
    asset_server: Res<AssetServer>,
) {
    commands.spawn(PixelCameraBundle::from_resolution(320, 240, true));

    commands.spawn(SpriteBundle {
        texture: asset_server.load("my-pixel-art-sprite.png"),
        sprite: Sprite {
            anchor: Anchor::BottomLeft,
            ..Default::default()
        },
        ..Default::default()
    });
}
```
