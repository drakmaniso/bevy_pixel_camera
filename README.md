# bevy_pixel_camera

A simple pixel-perfect camera plugin for Bevy, suitable for pixel-art.

This crates makes it possible to correctly display low-resolution 2d
graphics with Bevy's default renderer and sprites.

While it is possible to achieve pixel-perfect rendering with Bevy's own
camera and `OrthographicProjection`, doing so correctly requires to
configure it in a specific way (you can't just use
`OrhtographicCameraBundle`).

This plugin provides a camera which can be easily configured by specifying
either the size of the virtual pixels, or the desired resolution.

It also includes a quad mesh resource to replace the default one used in
Bevy's `SpriteBundle`. The default quad has its origin at the center of the
image, but if the image has an odd width or height, that origin is not
pixel-aligned. The resource included in this plugin puts the origin at the
bottom-left corner of the image.

Finally, the crate also includes a separate plugin to put an opaque border
around the desired resolution. This way, if the window size is not an exact
multiple of the virtual resolution, anything out of bounds will still be
hidden.

### Comparison with other methods

There is several possible methods to render pixel-art based games. This
crate simply upscale each sprite, and correctly align them on a virtual
pixel grid. Another option would be to render the sprites to an offscrenn
texture, and then upscale only this texture. There is advantages and
drawbacks to both approaches:
- the offscreen method is probably more efficient in most cases;
- in both cases the coordinates of non-moving sprites must be manually kept
  on integer coordinates;
- forgetting to use rounded coordinates will result in much worse results
  with the offscreen method; that's why this approach should probably be
  paired with a specialized sprite system based on integer transforms;
- the method in this crate allows for smoother scrolling and movement of
  sprites, if you're willing to temporarily break the alignment on virtual
  pixels (this would be even more effective with a dedicated upscaling
  shader).

### Example code

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;
use bevy_pixel_camera::{
    PixelBorderPlugin, PixelCameraBundle, PixelCameraPlugin, PixelSpriteQuad
};

fn main() {
    App::build()
        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
        .add_plugin(PixelCameraPlugin)
        .add_plugin(PixelBorderPlugin {
            color: Color::rgb(0.1, 0.1, 0.1),
        })
        .add_startup_system(setup.system())
        .run();
}

fn setup(
    mut commands: Commands,
    asset_server: Res<AssetServer>,
    mut materials: ResMut<Assets<ColorMaterial>>,
    quad: Res<PixelSpriteQuad>,
) {
    commands.spawn_bundle(PixelCameraBundle::from_resolution(320, 240));

    let sprite_handle = materials.add(asset_server.load("my-pixel-art-sprite.png").into());
    commands.spawn_bundle(SpriteBundle {
        material: sprite_handle,
        mesh: quad.clone().into(),
        ..Default::default()
    });
}
```
